## How do I Pokemon?

This Pokemon Kids web app was initially created for younger Pokemon fans ages 5 and up, who are just beginners - to learn more about the Pokemon World using a simple Pokedex interface, create Pokemon Mad Libs and take fun quizzes.

It has since morphed to a one-stop online resource for 'Parents' of younger Pokemon fans where the adults can learn the Pokemon basics, the trading card game and more - so they can have better conversations with their kiddos.

  - Pokemon Crash Course 101 - answers to all your Frequently Asked Questions

- Contact Form
  - users can leave their email and submit inquiries or share feedback
